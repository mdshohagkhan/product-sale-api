## üåü Overview

This is a robust **ASP.NET Core Web API** designed for managing products and their associated sales data. Built with **Entity Framework Core**, it provides a comprehensive set of RESTful endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product and sales entities, including relationships.

This API serves as a backend solution for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, or any application requiring efficient product and sales data handling.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **RESTful API Endpoints**: Full CRUD support for `Product` entities.
* **Sales Relationship**: Seamlessly manage `Sale` data associated with products.
* **Eager Loading**: Retrieve product data along with their related sales using `Include`.
* **Database Integration**: Leverages **Entity Framework Core** for efficient data access and persistence.
* **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive API documentation for easy testing and understanding of endpoints.
* **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Handles development and production settings appropriately.
* **Image Upload (Potential)**: Integration with `IWebHostEnvironment` suggests capability for file uploads, likely product images.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later.
* A SQL Server instance (LocalDB, Express, or full SQL Server) or another database supported by Entity Framework Core (configured in `appsettings.json`).
* (Optional but Recommended) A tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or your browser for testing API endpoints.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mdshohagkhan/product-sale-api.git](https://github.com/mdshohagkhan/product-sale-api.git)
    cd product-sale-api
    ```
    *(If your repository URL is different, please update this line.)*

2.  **Update Database Connection String:**
    Open `appsettings.json` and configure your database connection string under the `ConnectionStrings` section.

    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ProductSaleDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
      },
      // ... other settings
    }
    ```
    *Adjust `Server` and `Database` names as per your setup.*

3.  **Apply Migrations:**
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following commands to create or update your database schema:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
    *(If you haven't created initial migrations, you might need to run `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` first, then `dotnet ef database update`)*.

4.  **Restore NuGet Packages:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:5001` (for HTTPS).
